## 📊 DCTI Scoring Logic
The **Digital Commerce Trust Index** evaluates four major pillars:
1. **SSL/TLS Integrity (25%):** Protocol strength and certificate authority verification.
2. **Domain Metadata (25%):** Age of domain, TLD reputation, and DNS health.
3. **Policy Transparency (25%):** Link detection for Refund, Privacy, and Shipping policies.
4. **Reputation Signals (25%):** Cross-referencing against global scam reports and phishing keywords.
